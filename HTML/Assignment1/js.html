JavaScript is the programming language of the web. <br>
It adds interactivity to websites (forms, buttons, menus, etc.). <br>
JavaScript can update content, validate forms, and handle events. <br>
It supports both client-side and server-side development (Node.js). <br>
Popular libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue use JavaScript. <br>
It is essential for building dynamic web applications. <br>
With ES6+, JavaScript has modern features like classes, promises, and modules. <br>
