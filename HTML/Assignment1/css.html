CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls the design and layout of web pages. <br>
It is used to style HTML elements like colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. <br>
CSS makes websites attractive and user-friendly. <br>
It supports selectors, classes, and IDs to target elements. <br>
With CSS3, features like animations, transitions, and flexbox were introduced. <br>
It separates content (HTML) from presentation (CSS). <br>
Modern web design relies heavily on responsive CSS using media queries.
